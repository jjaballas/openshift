Terminology

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 3.11 is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

- nodes vs. masters

   - nodes are instances of RHEL 7 or Red Hat Atomic Host with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) installed

   - Nodes are where end-user applications run

   - Nodes are orchestrated by masters

   - node daemon and other software run on node

   - Master Host -- instance of RHEL or Red Hat Atomic Host

       - Primary functions:

            - Orchestrate all activities on nodes
            - Know and maintain state within OpenShift environment


- Pod -- one or more containers deployed together on one host


- Service -- Defines logical set of pods and policy for accessing them

Concept/Object              DescriptionConcept/Object
	
Containers and images       Building blocks for deploying applications

Pods and services           Let containers communicate with each other
                            and with proxy connections

Projects and users          Provide means for communities to organize
                            and manage content together

Builds and image streams    Let you build working images and react to new
                            images

Deployments                 Add support for software development and
                            deployment life cycle

Routes                      Announce service to the world
                            
Templates                   Let you create many objects at once based on
                            parameters

What is Docker?

  -> packaging technology for containers

What is a Container?

  -> a running image of a Docker image
	
What is a Pod?

  -> one or more containers deployed together on host
  -> smallest compute unit you can define, deploy, manage


What is a Service?

  -> serves as internal load balancer
  -> identifies set of replicated pods
  -> proxies connections it receives to identified pods

What are labels?

  -> used to organize, group, choose API objects

What is the Scheduler?

  -> Determines placement of new pods onto nodes within OpenShift cluster
  -> Reads pod data, tries to find node that is good fit
  -> Does not modify pod, merely creates binding that ties pod to node
